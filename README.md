# One pager MecaSF 

## Why this page ?
This one-pager was created as an exercise during my training at [BeCode](https://becode.org). It has no other purpose than to practice coding in HTML and CSS.

## Issues 

How do I properly calibrate the parallax so that foreground content corresponds to background height ? More specifically, how do I adapt the scrolling speed so that the foreground and background reach their respective bottoms at the same time ?
